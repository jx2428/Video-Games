### EDAV Final Project - Video Games Analysis
Group:12 Yaoling Wang, Jiashu Xia, Siqi Chen

Video games are a topic worth exploring among modern society. Some people treat them as a way of entertainment or pressure release and spend a substainable amount of time to improve rankings, euqipments or game experience. In this project, our team wants to explore three main questions relating to the platforms -- the places where the video games are published, the difference between critics' preference and users' preference, and the difference between popularity in US and Japan.
