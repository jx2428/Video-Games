Some people treat them as a way of entertainment or pressure release and spend a substainable amount of time to improve rankings, euqipments or game experiences. In this project, our team wants to explore three main questions relating to the platforms  the places where the video games are published, the difference between popularity in different regions, and the disparity between critics preference and users preference. Which platform contributes most to the video games? Is there any change over time? In terms of comparing the competitiveness of platforms, we are mainly interested in two main areas: the total number of games published and the total amount of sales generated by that platform. What are the top 5 popular games and genres across the world? What are the sale differnces in North America, Europe, Japan and other regions? We could sum up the global sales for each game on different plaforms and then compare them. We could use stacked bar charts to compare the sales of different genres in different regions. What are the critics preference and users preference? How are they different? To help players obtain a comprehensive review on video games, data source provides critics scores and users scores. From these two columns, we could sort the most popular genres among critics and general players based on a standardized scoring scale (out of ten), and study what the influential factors are. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Siqi Chen was responsible for collecting the data and the video games sales dataset studied in this project was collected from Kaggle.com link: https://www.kaggle.com/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019. The data set we used is a continue work on this original dataset linkhttps://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales There are total 55,792 records in the dataset as of April 12th, 2019. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. The publisher collected over 55,000 records from VGChartz, which is a video game sales tracking website that provides weekly sales figures of console software and hardware by region. VGChartz provides sales data for all current gaming consoles and portables, as well as retail gaming software for all major platforms. The main service provided by VG Chartz is weekly charts of hardware and software sales for the video game consoles sold by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. This dataset is credible since i) it includes metadata, such as subtitle, tags, overview description and cover image, ii) it has file descriptions and used appropriate file formats, and iii) it has a public kernel and task. Combined, it achieved a total usability score of 7.6. We chose this dataset over the original one because it was a latest version and had higher usability score (only 5.9 was reached for the original dataset, and the file description was missing as well). Variables included but not limitied in this study are: Rank - Ranking of overall sales Name - Name of the game Platform - Platform of the game (i.e. PC, PS4, XOne, etc.) Genre - Genre of the game (12 genres: Action, Adventure, Sports, etc.) Publisher - Publisher of the game (i.e. Sony Computer Entertainment, Activision, Rockstar Games, Capcom, etc.) Developer - Developer of the game Critic Score - Critic score of the game (out of 10) User Score - Users score the game (out of 10) Total Shipped - Total shipped copies of the game Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions) NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions) PAL_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions) JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions) Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) Year - Year of release of the game (from 1996 to 2018) It is a pity for us to see its lateset updates was three years ago. We were not able to analyze the new released PS5 sales figures since the gaming cosole was released in November 2020 and the data has not been collected. After carefully inspecting the dataset, we found many data in our cvs data file were missing. For instance, column VGChartz_Score did not contain any value. A lot of sales data, including Global sales, NA sales, PAL sales, JP sales and other sales were not available either. We will first remove those NA values and check if the data is still usable for later study. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Brief View of the Dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Brief View of the Dataset Here is a brief view of the first 20 rows of the dataset. Let us also take a view at all variables of the data. ## [1] &quot;Rank&quot; &quot;Name&quot; &quot;basename&quot; &quot;Genre&quot; ## [5] &quot;ESRB_Rating&quot; &quot;Platform&quot; &quot;Publisher&quot; &quot;Developer&quot; ## [9] &quot;VGChartz_Score&quot; &quot;Critic_Score&quot; &quot;User_Score&quot; &quot;Total_Shipped&quot; ## [13] &quot;Global_Sales&quot; &quot;NA_Sales&quot; &quot;PAL_Sales&quot; &quot;JP_Sales&quot; ## [17] &quot;Other_Sales&quot; &quot;Year&quot; &quot;Last_Update&quot; &quot;url&quot; ## [21] &quot;status&quot; &quot;Vgchartzscore&quot; &quot;img_url&quot; Obviously, there are many redundant variables in our dataset. We will not be interested in investigating the url of the game, or the update information about the game, etc. Thus, we deleted a series of useless variables that include basename, ESRB_Rating, Developer, VGChartz_Score, Total_Shipped, Last_Update, url, status, Vgchartzscore, and img_url. This is what our updated dataset looks like: ## # A tibble: 6 x 13 ## Rank Name Genre Platform Publisher Critic_Score User_Score Global_Sales ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 Wii ~ Spor~ Wii Nintendo 7.7 NA NA ## 2 2 Supe~ Plat~ NES Nintendo 10 NA NA ## 3 3 Mari~ Raci~ Wii Nintendo 8.2 9.1 NA ## 4 4 Play~ Shoo~ PC PUBG Cor~ NA NA NA ## 5 5 Wii ~ Spor~ Wii Nintendo 8 8.8 NA ## 6 6 Poke~ Role~ GB Nintendo 9.4 NA NA ## # ... with 5 more variables: NA_Sales &lt;dbl&gt;, PAL_Sales &lt;dbl&gt;, JP_Sales &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Other_Sales &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;dbl&gt; Note that all missing values will be treated in the next section. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing data Count 4.2 Visualizing Missing data in dataset 4.3 Deleting NAs", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing data Count We can see the total number of NAs in each column for the dataset: ## Rank Name Genre Platform Publisher Critic_Score ## 0 0 0 0 0 49256 ## User_Score Global_Sales NA_Sales PAL_Sales JP_Sales Other_Sales ## 55457 36377 42828 42603 48749 40270 ## Year ## 979 4.2 Visualizing Missing data in dataset The blue represents missing values. The rows show a missing pattern and the columns represent the column level missing values. We can find out that the column rank,name,genre,platform, and publisher do not have missing values at all. However, there is a substaintial amount of data missing values for user score, critic score, and sales for all regions. In addition, the column user score has most missing values compared to other variables. 4.3 Deleting NAs We use na.omit to delete the rows with missing values and check the updated dataset with graph. Black area represents missing values. Since there is no dark area, our data is now practicable and usable after using na.omit(). "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Comparing the Competitiveness of Publishers &amp; Platforms 5.2 Top 5 Video Games &amp; Genres 5.3 Users and Critics Preference", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Comparing the Competitiveness of Publishers &amp; Platforms Here is a brief introduction on Platform information. We can see that PS3 and X360 have published most games and earned most sales among all platforms throughout years. Although Wii had some games, its sales amount is not comparable to that of PS3 and X360. Other platforms had less than 10 games and usually had less than 12.5 million sales. Then just by observing these two plots, we see that PS3 and X360 have almost dominated the video game market. However, did PS3 and X360 perform the best for every year? As we are interested in finding out the trend of platforms over time, we take the variable Year into our consideration. For the graph below, we only picked several platforms which we consider them to be significant (either have fair number of games or decent amount of sales) and classified all other platforms to the Other category so that we can be focused on influential platforms over the years. As the bar plot displays, we can see that it is not the case that PS3 and X360 dominate the market for the entire period. Before 2000, the video games market was pretty small. Most games at that time were on platforms that we do not even know about today. In 2001, playing on PS2 was a popular trend. Then, PS3 and X360 boomed from 2005 to 2010. These two platforms took up most market in that period and almost all of their sales were from 2005 to 2010. Later although they did publish more games, but since significant amount of sales data is missing/unavailable, we have no way to tell their performance after 2010. Except from missing values problem, Xone had a boom in 2014. Starting from 2015, NS and PS4 as the new generation of platforms have taken up the market and it is possible that they could replace PS3 and X360 in the future. Now let us take a look at publishers are in our dataset. Sony Computer Enterntainment has published most games over the years. Other competitive publishers include Capcom, Ubisoft, Konami, and Activision. Sony Computer Entertainment, Activision, Rockstar Games, Capcom, Ubisoft/Konami are the 5 publishers with most sales amount. Although Rockstar Games has the 3rd most selling amount, it has published less games than other competitive publishers. Thus, we decide not to include it in the top publishers list. 5.2 Top 5 Video Games &amp; Genres Graph above shows the total gobal sales for every game. The top five popular games across the world are: 1.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare 2.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 3.Grand Theft Auto IV 4.Assassins Creed 5.Grand Theft Auto V All of their global sales are over 7.5 millions. The graph displays the sales for different genres. The colors represent different regions. From the stacked bar chart, we can find out that Action is most popular genre whereas Action-Adventure is the least popular. The top five genres are: Action, Shooter, Role-plying, platform,and Adventure.In addition, we can see that Action and Shooter captures the majority game market. Next, we will look closer to the regional sales by genre. Obviously, North America players contributes most to the game market. The trend of popularity of genres in Europe, North America, and other regions are same as the global trend. Japan is slightly different. 5.3 Users and Critics Preference Critics generally influence the public opinion trends of games, and can promote game sales (or hit game sales) to a certain extent. Therefore, game companies that want to achieve a certain breakthrough in sales can first target on the preferences of these media and professional players. We have extremely limited data available for critics and users ratings on same video games as shown in the bar graph. Based on the data we have, it can be seen from the box plot that whether it is from general players or critics, the difference in the ratings of racing games is the smallest and the overall score is high. Reviewers all dislike Action-Adventure genre, which has low socre. Besides, it seems like general users and critics have a large discrepancy when rating Sports games. While users give Sports video game with score above 9, critics are overall not optimistic about sports games, which has the lowest score (below 6) among all genres of video games. For general players, we see there is a large gap in adventure and role-playing genre, and for critics, socres range a lot in Fighting genre. After plotting out the histogram of 95 critic scores and 95 user scores (using median), the distrubution of both critic and users scores are left skewed. We can notice general users give scores more loosely on same selected vedio games compared to critics. The user group generally give high score in a sense that all games have score above 6 and most of them have scores between 8 to 9. Comparatively, critic are more strict on evaluating; a few video games have score less than 6, and a large number of scores range from 6 to 9. Lets further look at the score difference for individual game. And we would now expect a large score difference in Sports genre. We have picked top-30 rated video games for analysis. The top-5 rated video games for users are: Red Dead Redemption, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Forza Motorsport 3 Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Fire Emblem Warriors BioShock Star OceanL The Last Hope International, MAG: Massive Action Game, Demons Souls We have top 5 rated video games for critics and they are: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars BioShock LittleBig Planet Street Fighter IV, Metal Gear Solid 4L Guns of the Patriots In general, users are more generous in giving scores for video games as we mentioned before. All of 30 selected games have scores above 9 from the perspective of users, whereas for critics, scores ranges from below 6 to 9. It is noteworthy that there is a large socre difference in video game FIFA18, in which users give scores above 9 whereas critics rate below 6. This observation is consistent with the huge difference in ratings in sports games. One possible reason could be users who give high scores are fans from FIFA or football. Similar scenario can be seen depending on the interests of users. To be more specific, users tend to review games they want to play and play games that they think they will enjoy. So some scores tend to be a bit high, often hovering between 7 and 9 and rarely dropping to a 6 or below. On the other hand, critics will measure various aspects when evaluating a video game: story plot, gameplay design, background music, game operation, etc. Due to the limitation of our dataset, we were not able to analyze the factor affecting scores. If we could gather more information about rating criteria, a more solid conclusion could be draw from analysis. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component North America Sales Europe Sales Other Sales Japan Sales By clicking the buttom, we can see the sales of genres with decreasing order for each region. In the D3 graph, we can clearly see the the sales trend changes in an interactive way. We could eaisly find the most popular and the least popular games for different regions and compare the sales differences. In particular, the top 3 genres for all regions are Action, Shooter, Role-playing. Additionally, Action is the most popular genre all over the world. For new video game producers, they could target on Action game to reach high level of sales. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitaion 7.2 Ending", " Chapter 7 Conclusion PS3 and X360 are the two most successful platforms in recent two decades because they had most games and most sales amount over time. However, their performances were not consistent every year. Most of their games and sales were from 2005 to 2010. Platforms like Xone, PS2 managed to take up some market value outside of the golden period. After 2015, games are being played on new platforms such as NS and PS4. These two platforms might have the potential to exceed PS3 and X360 in the future. Sony Computer Entertainment, Capcom, Ubisoft, Activision, and Konami are considered as the top 5 video game publishers as they published most games and have the most sellings. Action, Shooter, Role-plying, Platform, and Adventure are the top 5 popular genres all cross the world. The global sales for action and shooter games are over 50 million dollars. Europe, North America, and Other Regions has the similar trend with global sales, except for Japan. In Japan, Action, Role-plying, Shooter, Fighthing and Adventure are the top 5 popular ones. These regional sale changes might be caused by other resaons that needs futher investigation. The top 5 video games has three different games with different versions, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare version 4 and 2, Assassins Creed, Grand Theft Auto version 4 and 5. Therefore, the peoples euthusiam for video games could last a long time and good video games would attracts more players with version updated. Both critics and users give high score on racing games. In this genre, players will have higher expectation on new games given high scores of previous similar works. This expectation will also lever the bar for new game producers. But based on the unpopularity of racing genre, new games will grab public attention as well. For those who want to target on general users can focus on sports games, and FIFA18 is a lively example. Though critics may not favor this type of game, there will always be customers paying for new products as long as their passion to sports remain. 7.1 Limitaion All of our data analysis was conducted after eliminating all NA values. However, due to the fact that missing values in sales and in user/critic scores exist by a significant proportion of the entire dataset, the analysis and conclusion might well be biased. If sales data for each game were all available, the conclusion about platforms and publishers could change significantly. Similarly, the analysis and conlusion in section 5.3 are biased and the pattern only applies to limited data. This issue can be fixed in the future study by collecting more score data. Besides, one can continue studying how will platforms affect scores on video games. In addition, we have found that there are sale differences in different regions. We could focus on what factors contribute to the changes by collecting more datas for future investigation, such as promotions, updates, or price, etc. 7.2 Ending Game development companies and teams should also maintain their original intentions and pursue the goal of high-quality games based on player experience, rather than drived by profits or sales. The more they are in the context of fast consumption and fierce competition, the more they should focus on quality. Excellent games also play the role of conveying correct values and telling good stories like movies. This is also an important task on the shoulders of game companies and development teams. "]]
